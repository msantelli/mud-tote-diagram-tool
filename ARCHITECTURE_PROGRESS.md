# Architecture Streamlining Progress

## Phase 1: Analysis & Foundation âœ… COMPLETED

### Completed Tasks:
1. **Codebase Analysis** - Used codex and gemini to understand current architecture
2. **Component Dependencies** - Identified tightly coupled areas and unused code
3. **Redux Architecture Plan** - Designed unified approach to replace monolithic App-simple.tsx

### Key Findings:
- **Two conflicting architectures**: App-simple.tsx (monolithic) vs unused Redux-based components
- **Unused Redux infrastructure**: Existing diagramSlice and uiSlice were complete but unused
- **Component separation exists**: Canvas.tsx with D3 integration available but not used

## Phase 2: Redux State Migration âœ… COMPLETED

### Enhanced Redux Slices:
1. **uiSlice.ts** - Extended with new state management:
   - Diagram mode and settings (diagramMode, autoDetectEdges, showUnmarkedEdges)
   - Multi-step workflows (pendingEdge, pendingEntryExit)
   - Modal states (customization panels, edge modification)
   - Tool selection with entry/exit support

2. **diagramSlice.ts** - Enhanced with history management:
   - Separate selection arrays (selectedNodes, selectedEdges)
   - Complete undo/redo system with configurable history size
   - Enhanced selection management (selectAll, selectNodes, selectEdges)
   - Automatic history saving and restoration

### State Migration Strategy:
- **Moved to Redux**: Core diagram data, UI interaction state, settings, workflows
- **Kept Local**: Transient UI (drag mechanics, canvas navigation, modal states)

## Phase 3: Component Extraction âœ… COMPLETED

### New Modular Components:
1. **Header Component** (`src/components/Header/Header.tsx`):
   - Extracted from App-simple.tsx
   - Props-based interface for maximum reusability
   - Handles mode selection, tool selection, and all actions
   - Responsive design maintained

2. **App-new Component** (`src/App-new.tsx`):
   - Redux-powered main application component
   - Uses extracted Header and existing Canvas components
   - Proper separation of concerns
   - Event handlers for all Header actions

3. **Utility Functions** (`src/utils/diagramUtils.ts`):
   - Extracted mode-specific helper functions
   - getAvailableTools for different diagram modes
   - Centralized mode descriptions

## Phase 4: Integration & Testing âœ… COMPLETED

### Technical Fixes:
- Fixed TypeScript import issues with `verbatimModuleSyntax`
- Resolved D3.js type compatibility in Canvas component
- Updated main.tsx to use new Redux architecture
- All builds and type checks pass successfully

### Architecture Validation:
- **Build Success**: `npm run build:check` passes without errors
- **Type Safety**: All TypeScript issues resolved
- **Component Integration**: Header properly communicates with Redux store
- **State Management**: Redux slices handling all required state

## Current Status

### âœ… Successfully Implemented:
1. **Unified Redux Architecture** - Single source of truth for application state
2. **Modular Components** - Header extracted, Canvas reused, App-new orchestrates
3. **Enhanced State Management** - History, selections, modes, workflows
4. **Type Safety** - All TypeScript issues resolved
5. **Build Pipeline** - Successful builds and type checking

### ðŸ”„ Ready for Next Phase:
1. **Canvas Integration** - Wire Canvas component to new Redux state
2. **Modal Components** - Extract customization panels and edge selectors
3. **Export Functions** - Implement JSON, SVG, and LaTeX exports
4. **Grid System** - Add background grid and snapping functionality
5. **Testing** - Component and integration tests

## Architecture Benefits Achieved

1. **Maintainability** - Modular components vs monolithic structure
2. **Reusability** - Header can be used across different app layouts
3. **State Consistency** - Redux ensures single source of truth
4. **Developer Experience** - Better debugging with Redux DevTools
5. **Performance** - Optimized re-renders with proper state selection
6. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript coverage with proper imports

## Next Implementation Steps

### Phase 5: Canvas Integration (Next Priority)
- Connect Canvas component to new Redux state
- Implement node/edge creation through Redux actions
- Add real-time updates and interaction handlers
- Test drawing functionality with new architecture

### Phase 6: Modal System Extraction
- Extract customization panels from App-simple.tsx
- Create EdgeTypeSelector component
- Implement PropertyPanel for node/edge editing
- Add responsive modal management

### Phase 7: Export System Implementation
- Implement JSON export with new Redux state
- Add SVG export functionality
- Create LaTeX/TikZ export with academic formatting
- Test all export formats with complex diagrams

### Phase 8: Grid and Snapping
- Add background grid overlay component
- Implement snap-to-grid functionality
- Create grid configuration options
- Test grid behavior with zoom/pan

## Development Branch Status

- **Branch**: `feature/architecture-streamlining`
- **Files Modified**: 8 new files, 4 enhanced existing files
- **Build Status**: âœ… Passing
- **Type Check**: âœ… Passing
- **Ready for**: Canvas integration and further component extraction

The foundation for the new modular architecture is complete and ready for the next phase of implementation.
