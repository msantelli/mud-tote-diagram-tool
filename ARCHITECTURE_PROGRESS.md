# Architecture Streamlining Progress

## Phase 1: Analysis & Foundation ✅ COMPLETED

### Completed Tasks:
1. **Codebase Analysis** - Used codex and gemini to understand current architecture
2. **Component Dependencies** - Identified tightly coupled areas and unused code
3. **Redux Architecture Plan** - Designed unified approach to replace monolithic App-simple.tsx

### Key Findings:
- **Two conflicting architectures**: App-simple.tsx (monolithic) vs unused Redux-based components
- **Unused Redux infrastructure**: Existing diagramSlice and uiSlice were complete but unused
- **Component separation exists**: Canvas.tsx with D3 integration available but not used

## Phase 2: Redux State Migration ✅ COMPLETED

### Enhanced Redux Slices:
1. **uiSlice.ts** - Extended with new state management:
   - Diagram mode and settings (diagramMode, autoDetectEdges, showUnmarkedEdges)
   - Multi-step workflows (pendingEdge, pendingEntryExit)
   - Modal states (customization panels, edge modification)
   - Tool selection with entry/exit support

2. **diagramSlice.ts** - Enhanced with history management:
   - Separate selection arrays (selectedNodes, selectedEdges)
   - Complete undo/redo system with configurable history size
   - Enhanced selection management (selectAll, selectNodes, selectEdges)
   - Automatic history saving and restoration

### State Migration Strategy:
- **Moved to Redux**: Core diagram data, UI interaction state, settings, workflows
- **Kept Local**: Transient UI (drag mechanics, canvas navigation, modal states)

## Phase 3: Component Extraction ✅ COMPLETED

### New Modular Components:
1. **Header Component** (`src/components/Header/Header.tsx`):
   - Extracted from App-simple.tsx
   - Props-based interface for maximum reusability
   - Handles mode selection, tool selection, and all actions
   - Responsive design maintained

2. **App-new Component** (`src/App-new.tsx`):
   - Redux-powered main application component
   - Uses extracted Header and existing Canvas components
   - Proper separation of concerns
   - Event handlers for all Header actions

3. **Utility Functions** (`src/utils/diagramUtils.ts`):
   - Extracted mode-specific helper functions
   - getAvailableTools for different diagram modes
   - Centralized mode descriptions

## Phase 4: Integration & Testing ✅ COMPLETED

### Technical Fixes:
- Fixed TypeScript import issues with `verbatimModuleSyntax`
- Resolved D3.js type compatibility in Canvas component
- Updated main.tsx to use new Redux architecture
- All builds and type checks pass successfully

### Architecture Validation:
- **Build Success**: `npm run build:check` passes without errors

- **State Management**: Redux slices handling all required state

## Phase 5: Canvas Integration ✅ COMPLETED

### Canvas Component Enhancements:
1. **Full Tool Support** - Added support for entry/exit/edge tools in click handlers
2. **Redux Integration** - Canvas properly connected to enhanced Redux state
3. **History Management** - All actions (node creation, movement, edge creation) save to history
4. **Drag Operations** - Smooth drag-and-drop with proper Redux state updates
5. **Error Resolution** - Fixed infinite loop and variable initialization issues

### useDiagram Hook Improvements:

   - Consistent backdrop and styling
   - Keyboard and click-outside handling
   - Props-based interface for title and content
   - Customizable width and z-index support

2. **EdgeTypeSelector Modal** (`src/components/EdgeTypeSelector/EdgeTypeSelector.tsx`):
   - Full integration with Redux state management
   - Dynamic edge type filtering based on diagram mode
   - Color-coded edge type buttons with descriptions
   - Complete edge creation workflow with history management
   - Dependencies: `getAvailableEdgeTypes`, `getEdgeColor`, `getEdgeTypeDescription`

3. **NodeCustomizationPanel Modal** (`src/components/NodeCustomizationPanel/NodeCustomizationPanel.tsx`):

- **Code Organization**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated utility files

## Phase 6.5: Edge Creation Workflow ✅ COMPLETED

### Critical Missing Functionality Restored:
The original App-simple.tsx edge creation workflow was missing from the new architecture. This phase restored full edge drawing capabilities to match the original user experience.

### Edge Creation Implementation:
1. **Two-Click Workflow** (`src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`):
   - First click selects source node (highlighted with orange border)
   - Second click selects target node and triggers edge creation
   - Visual feedback with 4px orange border for source node selection
   - Automatic state reset on tool changes or canvas clicks

2. **Smart Edge Type Detection**:
   - **Unmarked Mode**: Creates `unmarked` edges immediately when enabled
   - **Auto-Detect MUD**: Automatically determines PV/VP/PP/VV based on node types
   - **Manual Selection**: Shows EdgeTypeSelector modal for user choice

3. **State Management Integration**:
   - Local Canvas state (`edgeSourceNodeId`) tracks current edge creation session
   - Full Redux integration with `addEdge`, `setPendingEdge`, `setShowEdgeTypeSelector`
   - Proper history management for all edge creation operations

### Technical Implementation:
- **Canvas Component**: Complete edge creation logic with visual feedback
- **Helper Functions**: `autoDetectMUDEdgeType`, `handleEdgeCreation`
- **Visual States**: Orange borders for source selection, tool-specific cursors
- **State Cleanup**: Automatic reset on tool changes and canvas interactions

### User Experience Restored:
1. **Select Edge Tool** → Cursor changes to crosshair
2. **Click Source Node** → Orange border indicates selection
3. **Click Target Node** → Edge created based on current mode:
   - MUD + Auto-Detect → PV/VP/PP/VV edge created immediately
   - Unmarked Mode → Unmarked edge created immediately
   - Manual Mode → EdgeTypeSelector modal opens

**Result**: Edge drawing functionality now fully operational with feature parity to original implementation.

## Phase 7: Export System Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
